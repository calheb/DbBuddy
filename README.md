When working with a development and local database copy, it can be cumbersome to constantly copy and paste new connection strings.
Use a terminal command instead.

Current Db: Local Db

Main Menu
---------
Select an option:
[1] Local Db
[2] Remote Db
[3] Settings
[4] Exit

```
Once the connection strings have been set, simply toggle back and forth with 

```
dbb set local
```

(or)

```
dbb set remote
```

The Db settings can be set through either the interface with (```dbb start```), or by manually editing the json file located in the installation folder.
(Run the program to generate a file with blank defaults, or create one.

### Sample connectionStrings.json file

```json
{
  "LocalDb": "Data Source=localDbName; Integrated Security=true; Initial Catalog=YourDatabaseName; uid=YourUserName; Password=yourPassword;",
  "LocalDbName": "LocalDbName",
  "RemoteDb": "\"Data Source=remoteDbName; Integrated Security=true; Initial Catalog=YourDatabaseName; uid=YourUserName; Password=yourPassword;\"",
  "RemoteDbName": "RemoteDbName",
  "ConfigPath": "C:\\Users\\Caleb\\source\\repos\\TestWebsite\\TestWebsite\\Web.config",
  "CurrentDb": "Local Db"
}
```
